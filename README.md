# A Formal Request for Friday Drinks üçª
### *A Student's Perspective on Why We Should Have Social Drinks Every Week*

As a student, being able to unwind with classmates and teachers in an informal setting has been great for developing a feeling of 'mateship' within the class. Studies have shown that drinking with colleages (or in our case classmates) has many benefits, some of which I have listed below:

### 1. Improves Teamwork üìà
Classmates become more comfortable with each other and with teachers when in a social setting opposed to a structured classroom setting. We get the opportunity to socialise and discuss issues other than coding or topics other than those we are covering in class. This in turn allows us to create closer bonds with each other, which will benefit us when we are having trouble in class and need to turn to classmates for assistance.

### 2. Increased Creativity and Problem Solving Skills üí°
[ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810016303713) states that a moderate intake of alcohol is proven to increase creativity and problem solving skills. Weekly drinks will be of great advantage during the weeks where we are completing major assessments as it will a) provide students with a chance to unwind and b) potentially allow students to think of alternative solutions that they might have otherwise missed.

### 3. Informal Setting üé≠
Being able to meet with teachers in an informal setting allows us to build a better relationship with them (and might help them remember our names faster). Speaking to teachers and previous cohort attendees person to person instead of within the roles of teacher and student brings another dynamic to the relationship.

### 4. Celebrating Our Success üéâ
Having the drinks on a Friday afternoon allows students to celebrate surviving another week of bootcamp and boosts class morale.

### 5. Good For Our Health üç∑
According to a study by the [American Study of Human Genetics](http://www.ashg.org/press/201510-aging-lifestyle.html), people who had one or two drinks per day showed a biological age that was much closer to their chronological age when compared to those who didn't drink. So really you'd be doing us all a favour by providing drinks.

### 6. A Chance to Network ü•Ç
By inviting previous students to come and socialise, it will give current students a chance to network with other people who are a) currently in the industry and b) have previously experienced what we are going through. It will give us an opportunity to see where our future lies upon graduating from the bootcamp.

### 7. It's Inclusive üçª
By providing a small range of non-alcoholic drinks, you can cater to students who may not drink (or who may not feel like drinking that night). Offering weekly drinks means that students who may have missed the once-off drinks - such as those at the beginning and end of Term 1 - due to prior commitments such as work will have the opportunity to network more often.

### 8. It's Fun üéä
Being able to let your hair down with other students over drinks? It's *very* fun.
